# YouTube Playlist Quick Remove
A Chrome extension I use to quickly remove videos from a playlist.

## Installation

### Using as a Chrome Extension
1. Manage Extensions
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Load Unpacked
4. Select the extension folder
5. (Optional) Disable Developer Mode

### Using with Tampermonkey
Create a new script in Tampermonkey and copy the contents of `extension/youtube-olaylist-quick-remove.js` into it.

## Support
I don't plan on providing support if it isn't working for you, though I'll keep it up to date since I use it.
